# Advanced-Chinese-Rap-Lyric-Generation-with-Integrated-Markov-Chain-and-LSTM-Models
This paper aims to innovatively generate Chinese rap lyrics using advanced machine learning technologies, specifically Markov Chains and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The paper begins with the comprehensive collection and cleaning of Chinese rap lyrics data, covering key steps in data preprocessing, including word segmentation and tagging using Jieba. Firstly, a Markov chain model based on enhanced label analysis is constructed for basic lyrics generation. Subsequently, an LSTM model was built to predict the next word in the sequence by learning from the sequence of lyrics. Specifically, the data is prepared by converting the lyrics into a sequence of tags and creating corresponding tags for LSTM training. The architecture of the LSTM model was carefully designed to suit the needs of text generation, including embedding and LSTM layers. Additionally, we trained this model, adjusting hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance. In the testing and evaluation phase, we assessed the uniqueness and coherence of the Markov Chain model. For the LSTM model, we used quantitative metrics such as Perplexity or BLEU scores to evaluate the linguistic quality of the generated lyrics, assessing the creativity, thematic consistency, and overall appeal of the LSTM generated lyrics.
